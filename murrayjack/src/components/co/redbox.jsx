      <li>
        Working directly with our London and Sydney offices I was the senior
        lead developer on all our clients’ eCommerce sites, who are mainly large
        luxury retailers, the sites being very well known and taking millions of
        pounds per year in transactions
      </li>
      <li>
        We are mainly, but not exclusively use Microsoft development tools and
        nearly all our eCommerce applications run on load balanced Windows 2003
        Servers over clustered SQL server 2008 databases. Development is done in
        c# (2.0 &amp; 3.5), with the UI functionality done in a mixture of
        jQuery and Flash, I have developed other sites using MVC and straight
        HTML and CSS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since my time with the company I have technically lead and developed
        through the complete life cycle 2 of the companies largest eCommerce
        solutions, the first being the complete rebuild of the Fortnum and Mason
        web site, and the second being the new Bettys By Post site. Both sites
        were received as a great success and have seen increases in both traffic
        and revenue since the rebuilds shunning the global downturn, Christmas
        was a great time with one site showing a 40% increase in profit, winning
        the site an internal award.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both web applications consist of not only the main web site itself, but
        a back end CMS and stock management system, integrated real-time payment
        systems offering the usual credit cards and UK debit cards, bespoke
        shipping and handling functionality, and web and windows services
        connecting the site with their own in house merchandising systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also at the company I have been involved in installing and configuring
        Fortnum and Mason’s SharePoint intranet. Writing a number of web sites
        for our clients including prize sites for Pfizer, and being involved in
        the team that wrote the “reduce to stop” a web-based helper for people
        giving up smoking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Redbox Digital operate global development teams with developers in more
        than 5 countries and 4 time zones, so communication is critical to
        making projects happen correctly, on time and budget, we have created a
        number processes utilising cloud-based task management systems, instant
        messaging and Skype to successfully allow all the developers to work
        together.
