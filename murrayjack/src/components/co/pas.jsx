    <ul>
      <li>
        I was responsible for design specifications, change analysis,
        development, and database change scripts on several of the companyâ€™s
        core products, individually and as a member of a team.
      </li>
      <li>
        I designed and wrote a database-independent upgrade control that using
        an XML base script would upgrade all supported databases with one base
        script. The types of databases supported were SQL Server 6.5/7/2000,
        Access 95/97/2000, and Oracle 8i.
      </li>
      <li>
        I wrote the client part of the company internet site, this linked with
        SQL Server 7 databases on our internal network and using NT Services
        written by myself, and these updated the site every evening by sending
        XML files over FTP.
