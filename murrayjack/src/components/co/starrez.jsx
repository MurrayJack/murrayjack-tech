        lead through example and write a lot of code that shows how the company
        can move to a modern UI tech stack, to decouple the UI from the rest of
        the application code, and to include accessibility into everything we
        build. We are focusing on achieving a minimum of AA compliance of WCAG
        2.1 in everything we do.
