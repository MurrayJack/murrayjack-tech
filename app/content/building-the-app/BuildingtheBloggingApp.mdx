# Creating my blog site

In my endless hint for a decent todo / project app, I thought I might just blog the creation of this blog site.. kind blog-ception really but hey it might be fun

After listening the this syntax episode and for no bette plan I decided to use MDX, and as the rest of this tech site was in Gatsby it seemed a good combo

so where to start...

## Branch!

Always start with a new branch, always always always, not this again, branch!

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/

## Getting started

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/

In this link are the commands to get this started so lets go!

```
$ npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

then update tha gatsby-config.js with the new plugin

```
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ....
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  ],
}
```

The I added a MDX file to my /pages folder and ran

```
---
title: Hello, world!
path: /hello-world
date: 2019-01-29
---
# Hello, world!
```

```
$ npm run develop
```

and it didnt work

so I had the change the config.js to

```
 `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `mdx`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src`,
      },
    }
```

this makes sense as the files are on the file syatem and hey I need to go look there...

```
$  npm run develop
```

now we can launch the graphIQL and have a allMdx section, so when I run this query

```
query {
  allMdx {
    edges {
      node {
        frontmatter {
          title
          path
          date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I get the document I want, thats awesome!
