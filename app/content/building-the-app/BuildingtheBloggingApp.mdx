# Creating my blog site

In my endless hint for a decent todo / project app, I thought I might just blog the creation of this blog site, So apologies for the blog-ception. Ive pondered about making a blogging site before but always the issue is time, and to be honest  I am more in to the making that the writing, but after listening the latest Syntax episode I thought I might give it another go.

Im still super keen to do this in Gatsby and Markdown, so MDX looked a good opportunity to try this one again.

## Branch!

Always start with a new branch, always always always, not this again, branch!

## Off to the internet

So a quick search brings up the following plugin.. https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/

## Getting started

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/

In this link there are the commands to get this started so firstly install these packages:

<Javascript>
$ npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
</Javascript>

then update the gatsby-config.js with the new plugin

<Javascript>{
`module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ....
    'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
  ],
}
`}</Javascript>

The I added a MDX file to my /pages folder and ran


<Javascript>{
`---
title: Hello, world!
path: /hello-world
date: 2019-01-29
---
# Hello, world!
`}</Javascript>

<Javascript>{
`$ npm run develop
`}</Javascript>

and it didn't work

so I had the change the config.js to

<Javascript>{
`'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
    options: {
      name: 'mdx',
      path: './src',
  },
}
`}</Javascript>

this makes sense as the files are on the file system and hey I need to go look there...

<Javascript>{
`$  npm run develop
`}</Javascript>

now we can launch the gatsby graphIQL and have a allMdx section, so when I run this query

<Javascript>{
`query {
 allMdx {
   edges {
     node {
       frontmatter {
         title
         path
         date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
       }
      }
    }
  }
}
`}</Javascript>


I get the document I want, thats awesome! Now I need to actually build the site rather than just getting back random information
